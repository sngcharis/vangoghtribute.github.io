            <h3 class="para-title">Early Life and Education</h3>
            <p>
              Vincent Willem van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 into an
              upper-middle-class family in Groot-Zundert, Netherlands.
            </p>
            <p>
              Van Gogh was a serious and thoughtful child. He was taught at home
              by his mother and a governess, and in 1860 was sent to the village
              school.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1864, he was placed in a boarding school where he felt
              abandoned, and campaigned to come home. In 1866, his parents sent
              him to the middle school in Tilburg, where he was deeply unhappy.
            </p>
            <p>
              In March 1868, he abruptly returned home. He later wrote that his
              youth was "austere and cold, and sterile".
            </p>
            <p>
              In July 1869, Van Gogh's uncle obtained a position for him at the
              art dealers. By this time, Van Gogh was fluent in French, German
              and English, as well as his native Dutch.
            </p>
            <p>
              In June of 1873, Van Gogh was transferred to the Groupil Gallery
              in London.
            </p>
            <h3 class="para-title">Pastoral Days</h3>
            <p>
              In April 1876 he returned to England to take unpaid work as a
              supply teacher in a small boarding school. However, it did not
              work out and he left to become a Methodist minister's assistant.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1876, he returned home at Christmas for six months and took
              work at a bookshop in Dordrecht. He was unhappy in the position
              and immersed himself in religion, and became increasingly pious
              and monastic.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1877, his family sent him to live with his uncle in Amsterdam
              to support his religious conviction and his desire to become a
              pastor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Van Gogh failed his theology entrance examination and left his
              uncle's house in July 1878.
            </p>
            <p>
              In January 1879, he took up a post as a missionary at a
              coal-mining district of Borinage in Belgium.
            </p>
            <p>
              To show support for his impoverished congregation, he gave up his
              comfortable lodgings at a bakery to a homeless person, and moved
              to a small hut where he slept on straw.
            </p>
            <p>
              His squalid living conditions did not endear him to church
              authorities, who dismissed him for "undermining the dignity of the
              priesthood".
            </p>
            <h3 class="para-title">Finding Solace in Art</h3>
            <p>
              In the fall of 1880, Van Gogh decided to move to Brussels and
              become an artist. Though he had no formal art training, his
              younger brother, Theo offered to support van Gogh financially.
            </p>
            <p>
              He registered at the Académie in November 1880, where he studied
              anatomy and the standard rules of modelling and perspective.
            </p>
            <p>
              Van Gogh's art helped him stay emotionally balanced. In 1885, he
              began work on what is considered to be his first masterpiece,<span
                class="art-name"
                >The Potato Eaters</span
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              Van Gogh moved to Paris in March 1886 where he shared Theo's rue
              Laval apartment.
            </p>
            <p>
              When he first saw the impressionism artwork in Paris, he was
              inspired by the color and light. He began studying at Fernand
              Cormon's studio.
            </p>
            <h3 class="para-title">Artistic Breakthrough</h3>
            <p>In February 1888, Van Gogh sought refuge in Arles.</p>
            <p>
              The time in Arles became one of Van Gogh's more prolific periods.
              He completed 200 paintings, and more than 100 drawings and
              watercolors.
            </p>
            <p>
              His style became looser and more expressive. It also excel in his
              use of color.
            </p>
            <h3 class="para-title">Mental Health</h3>
            <p>
              In December 1888, after an altercation with his friend, Van Gogh
              returned to his room, where he was assaulted by voices and severed
              part of his left ear with a razor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Van Gogh was found unconscious the next morning by a policeman and
              taken to hospital.
            </p>
            <p>
              Van Gogh had no recollection of the event, suggesting that he may
              have suffered an acute mental breakdown. The hospital diagnosis
              was "acute mania with generalized delirium"
            </p>
            <p>
              For several months, Van Gogh continually suffered from
              hallucinations and delusions.
            </p>
            <h3 class="para-title">Asylum</h3>
            <p>
              Van Gogh voluntarily admitted himself to the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole
              asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence on 8 May 1889.
            </p>
            <p>
              During Van Gogh’s year at the asylum, he suffered from distressing
              mental attacks, incapacitating him for a total of several months.
              But for most of his time, he was mentally alert and worked
              intensively. Painting took up almost all the hours of the day.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the year in asylum, Van Gogh completed roughly 142
              paintings.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most famous paintings completed in the asylum includes
              <span class="art-name"
                >The Starry Night, Wheat Field with Cypresses, Irises</span
              >.
            </p>
            <h3 class="para-title">Death</h3>
            <p>
              On 27 July 1890, aged 37, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest.
              However, the bullet did not kill him.
            </p>
            <p>
              The bullet was deflected by a rib and passed through his chest
              without doing apparent damage to his internal organs.
            </p>
            <p>
              He passed away two days later on 29 July in the arms of his
              brother, Theo.
            </p>
            <h3 class="para-title">Legacy</h3>
            <p>
              In just over a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including
              around 900 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two
              years of his life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, Vincent van Gogh is considered one of the greatest artists
              in human history. Van Gogh's works are among the world's most
              expensive paintings.
            </p>
            <h3 class="para-title">Van Gogh Museum</h3>
            <p>
              In 1973, the
              <a href="https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en" target="_blank"
                >Van Gogh Museum</a
              >
              opened its doors in Amsterdam to make the works of Vincent van
              Gogh accessible to the public.
            </p>
            <p>
              The museum houses more than 200 paintings, 500 drawings and 750
              written documents including letters to Vincent’s brother, Theo.
            </p>
            <p>
              It became the second most popular museum in the Netherlands,
              regularly receiving more than 1.5 million visitors a year.
